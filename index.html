                My name is Nelson Scott and I believe that games matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was 13, I googled "How to make a video game". Now that I am 19 I have worked on many game projects both on my own and for hire. I currently develop games in Flash, MonoGame, HTML5, and Unity. Not only am I passionate about making games, but I also love playing them.
            </p>

            <p>With my games, I try to improve on what has come before and do something different. With every project I answer the question of "why does this game matter?". I can't wait to discover what crazy answers myself and other developers will come up with for that question.
            </p>

            <p>Currently I am studying Game Design and Development at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I work at Sharp Notions, LLC as a Game Developer Intern. My goal is to one day become a game producer.
